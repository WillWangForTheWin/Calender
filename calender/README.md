we have 3 creative parts for our project:
we are able to post public event on our calender. So users are able to post national holidays like Christmas and Thanksgiving to the calendar and everyone can see it.
We can click on the calendar to add events and in the pop-out box below the date will be pre-populated. We do not have to key in the date manually.
We can share events to other users by the share button so that other users can have the same event.
